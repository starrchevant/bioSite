        <p>Hi, my name is Shayla Starr in Chinese or in Mandarin Chinese my name is Zhang张 Mei美 . That’s right I was born abroad in Mainland China where I learned to speak my mother’s language. I‘ve seen a lot of the world at a young age, and I guess this is where I get my sense of adventure from. I consider myself an artist, entertainer, with a side of science. I love art, music, animation, and so much more.

            <p>My goals and aspirations are to become a professional inside of the world of entertainment. Academically I love the idea of becoming a lawyer or working with robotics within the entertainment industry. I also love being a good role model for my younger sister and showing her what girl power is all about.

            <p>I have a puppy, she’s a Beagle name Minnie named after Minnie mouse, because of her floppy ears. Minnie always seems to make me laugh by running around our yard for chasing air for no apparent reason.
